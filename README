Hyperchem Info Extractor (HIE) is a tool developed to work with Hyperchem (Hypercube INC.)
It provides a rapid way to extrct the information of Hyperchem logs

HIE 1.0 (on-screen) will display on the screen the information wich has been selected by the user (Energies, ZPE, molecular symmetry and molecular orbitals [including orbitals with alfa-beta label by MP2 correlation])

HIE 2.1.1 (on-file) will create a file with the energies of the molecules studied. The program will search on all .log and .txt files for this information and will write it down on a txt file


The program is in spanish. Soon I will translate it! :D
